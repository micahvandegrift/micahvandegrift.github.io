          <p>I am an information professional with an interdisciplinary academic background, interests in many flavors of technology, and a penchant toward foodie/music/film snobbery. I am primarily interested in the future of academic publishing and digital humanities, and I dabble in biblio/alt-metrics, LIS pedagogy, and more. I am proud to have started my career as the Scholarly Communication Librarian at Florida State University, my alma mater thrice over. I also have an undying love for the academic study of contemporary popular culture.</p>
